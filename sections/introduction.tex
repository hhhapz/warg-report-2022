\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}

The Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group (WARG) is currently developing Project
Icarus, a vertical take-off and landing UAV fixed wing, capable of autonomous
flight and landing. It does so by making use our own, custom custom flight
controller; ZeroPilot, alongside the in-house Computer Vision (CV) system to
create an aircraft that can be navigated without much human input. Project
Icarus's key subsystems make use of a variety of technologies and components to
accomplish this goal, including training our own models for landing, a custom
flight and tracking system, and a unique airframe optimized for this year's
student competition.
