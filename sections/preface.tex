\textbf{Big City} has asked for bids to improve the efficiency and
effectiveness of downtown passenger transit by developing a sub-scale UAS
prototype to meet specific mission requirements..

The Waterloo Aerial Robotics Group proposes Project Icarus: an innovative
solution involving hybrid multirotor fixed wing aircraft that allow for
efficient, stable long range flight while also maintaining the manoeuvrability
and compact takeoff/landing requirements mandated by Big City. The solution
presented is capable of either fully autonomous flight with given flight plans,
or remotely operated flight from a ground-based operator.
