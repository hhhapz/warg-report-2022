\subsection{Path Optimization Model and Process}
\label{sec:path-optimization}

Path Optimization is handled by the groundside IMACS module, and then relayed
to the aircraft using one of the command and control links. In each
communication cycle, IMACS is updated on the position of the aircraft, and will
always re-sequence the entire remainder of the waypoints to the UAS, with a
special "starting" waypoint that contains the last known location of the
aircraft by IMACS. This allows air-side path management to be resistant to
large transmission delays.

Task 1 involves safely navigating around a restricted area while flying from a
starting point to a rendezvous point. To handle rerouting, a directed graph is
used to create a path from the current position to the rejoin point while
minimizing distance and avoiding restricted areas.

Task 2 involves taxiing passengers at waypoints for fares, with the goal of
profit maximization. To accomplish this, a reinforcement learning algorithm is
employed. The algorithm takes into account the number of passengers and their
pickup and drop-off locations, the distance and time required to reach each
waypoint,  fuel efficiency, time constraints, and leaving in a margin for
potential unforeseen events.
