\subsection{Analysis of Mission Requirements}

The competition requirements prove to create unique restrictions for the
aircraft design. For one, passenger safety considerations mean there is a need
for realism that comes at the cost of efficiency.

\subsection{Novel Approaches to Mission Requirements}

\todo{Discuss the following ideas potentially?}

\begin{itemize}
	\item using custom carbon fiber components: we've never done this before
		and it requires setting up the entire process for doing layups,
		and designing parts beforehand
	\item something specific from zeropilot: transitioning between vtol and fw:
		mixin for different flight controls and running them in parallel for a
		short time
	\item our custom cv models + implementation specific details for landing pad
\end{itemize}
